# Tensorflow Implementation of OCGAN
This repository provides a [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) implementation of the *OCGAN* presented in
CVPR 2019 paper "[OCGAN: One-class Novelty Detection Using GANs with Constrained Latent Representations](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Perera_OCGAN_One-Class_Novelty_Detection_Using_GANs_With_Constrained_Latent_Representations_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf)".

The author's implementation of *OCGAN* in MXNet is at [here](https://github.com/PramuPerera/OCGAN).
